"""Implements several tomography basis.

The following tomography basis are implemented for 1-qubit state tomography:
- Pauli basis.
- The tetrahedral basis that realises a SIC-POVM.
- A basis that can be arbitrarily large and that consists in approximately
  equidistant states spread around the Bloch sphere. Might be useful if
  there is a need for redundant information.
