"""Module to help performing quantum state tomography.

This module implements several methods to perform quantum state tomography. For
the moment, only 1-qubit state tomography has been implemented but most of the
methods should either be already compatible for multi-qubit state tomography or
should only require a small investment to adapt.

The package provides 2 main modules:
- qtom.basis that implements several tomography basis.
- qtom.fit that provides several optimisation methods to reconstruct the density
  matrix of the measured state from the measurements.
