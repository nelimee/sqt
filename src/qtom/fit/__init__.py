"""Implements several state reconstruction methods.

The following state reconstruction methods are implemented for 1-qubit state
tomography:
- "pauli" is a reconstruction method that only works with measurements
  performed using the PauliMeasurementBasis and that is based on the
  decomposition of an arbitrary density matrix into a weighted sum of Pauli
  matrices.
- "lssr" that stands for "Least Squares Solving with Renormalisation" is one of
  the method implemented in the qiskit package. It basically solves a least
  squares problem without any constraints on the density matrix (that is the
  solution of the least square problem) and the renormalise it to ensure that
  the reconstructed density matrix is within the right matrix space.
- "mle" that stands for "Maximum Likelyhood Estimation" uses
  scipy.optimize.minimize non linear least square optimizer to try to find the
  density matrix that will minimise the negated log-likelyhood cost function.
- "grad" that performs a projected gradient descent to try to find the
  density matrix that will minimise the negated log-likelyhood cost function.
