This project has been made during the Quantum Computing Summer School 2021 at Los Alamos National Laboratory with the help of:

- Carleton Coffrin
- Marc Vuffray
- Andrey Lokhov
- Jon Nelson

## Quick start

In order to start using the code in this repository, first install the `qtom` package with the command
```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```
The above command should be issued **in the main folder** of this repository, i.e. a call to `ls` should show you the `src` directory and the `setup.py` file.
